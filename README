So basically Hospital Management System + machine learning

first patient comes regiater himself & interact with the doctor.
doctor diagonse karta hai & then test assign karta ..

lets suppose heart test.. so know our job is to predict the probab. of getting heart disease.

as we all know patients are more than  doctor. According to research the ratio is 1:834 in india.
Hence doctor are busy af.

Our job is to rank patients by the order of severity. So that doctor gives more preference to that patient.

Test: heart test, kidney test, liver test , we will expand more . 
right know we won't add any x-ray images dataset disease because then we have to apply deep learning . which is just naaa bro.
