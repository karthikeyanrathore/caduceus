DESCRIBE
========

Hospitals are medical corporation which manages each hospital department, staff, doctors and provides
health care facilities to patients who may be suffering with certain type of disease or illness etc.
In order to supervise/govern large number of staff and patients in a hospital, they require a hospital management
software which is controlled by administrator of the hospital. The responsibilty of the software is to record 
each patient data, allocate patient to respective ward, assign doctor to each patient etc. The objective of the
software is to provide a efficient process in managing health care institues to minimize time and avoid disorientation which
helps the staff and also patients, as hospital environment can propose anxiety in patients.



PROBLEM
=======

According to the research, in India the ratio of doctor to patient is 1:1700. Due to low doctor to patient ratio,
it creates complexity in the management of hospitals. As the study shows, that the doctors can't offer adequate amount of
time to each patient and can't manage as well as can't predict to give more preference to which patient who might be suffering.
If a patient is suffering with diseases in multiple organs, the ideal solution for the doctor is to provide reasonable amount
of time to that patient. As there are many patients with different level of severity of disease, doctors need a platform
where they could rank patients by the level of severity and manage each patient due to low ratio of doctor to patient.


Team Assigned Task
==================

We are a team of three members and our responsibilities are defined as follows:-

1. Karthikeyan will be responsible for building the API for the machine learning models and in creating the pipeline for
continuous machine learning in the backend. For building the machine learning model, he will be responsible for various task such
as research, finding data, clearning data and various other sub-task for the assembly of ML model.He will be assessed 
on the basis of accuracy of the models.

2. Tanuj will be responsible for constructing the architectural diagram for deploying our web application on AWS cloud.
He will also supervise the cloud database (RDS) and ensure that there are no security vulnerability in our software.
He will be assessed on the basis of security and time executed by each programs/ML model in our web application in the AWS cloud.

3. Manish will be responsible for designing the database schema and writing MySQL query for our web application. He will
also build UI/UX for the frontend part of the website and integrate the frontend to the backend application. He will be 
assessed on the basis of time execution of each MySQL query for large number of users and how user-friendly the website is.


CHALLENGES
==========

Challenges that we will encounter for building the prototype in three months is as follows:-

1. The Software/web application is not only for one or two hospitals but multiple hospitals, keeping this idea in mind
is to make the software much more customized for each hospital according to the given needs of the hospitals. The main 
intend of the software is to manage the hospital, record patients data and rank patients by the order of severity of 
diseases. For the prototype, the software will support heart disease and kidney disease and futher we will support more
diseases in the near future.

2. The issue that we will come across is integrating the database (MySQL), machine learning model API, backend and frontend
together and deploying the whole software/application on the AWS cloud and also making sure that there should be 
continous integrating/testing of the software with new added updates.



TIMELINE
========

FEB: Performing thorough research about the project in depth. Finding and collecting dataset for heart disease and
kidney dieases. Researching/reading various research paper in order to implement the machine learning model for heart and
kidney.

March: Cleaning / Manipulating with source dataset in order to achieve clean data because if the dataset is imprecise then
the machine learning algorithm will predict false output.

April: Improving the accuracy of the ML models and testing the ML models using various evaluation metrics. Creating API for 
both the diseases and deploying the API on cloud platform.


RESOURCES
=========

1. For Building the machine learning model, we will be using various python libraries such as tensorflow, matplotlib, pandas,
scikit learn, pickel for storing the models and integrating pickel model with flask_restful api builder.

2. For designing the schema of the database, we will be using Visual Paradigm and for database, we are using MySQL. SHA256
library for the encryption of user data.

3. For building the whole web application, we will use Flask python library for building the website and integrating each 
componenet such as API and database in the Flask application. AWS cloud for deploying the Flask application.



LIST PROJECTS (3)
=============

1. tictactoe AI: In the First year, me and my teammates manish and tanuj, we all simultaneously built a game tictactoe
where the users can play aginst other users and also the user can play against ai bot which was built using minimax 
algorithm. The algorithm predicts the best position on the board by evaluating each positon on the board efficiently.
The game was later deployed on a website using flask library.

2. AWSOME: In the Second year, me and my teammates manish and tanuj, we built a website where the user has to input his
facial image and using machine learning and spotify API, the model will predict human facial emotion either happy, sad or
neutral. According to the output of the model, the website will redirect the user to the relevant playlist of song using 
spotify API. The website was deployed on AWS cloud.

3. Lane Line Detection: In the third year, me and my teammates manish and tanuj, we built lane line detetion on the road
which is one of the most integral part of ADS autonomous driving system. In this project, we executed various computer 
vision algorithms to detect lane lines on the road.

USP
===
Our Project is a fresh project. The main USP of our project is that it solves the problem of managing the hospital staff and
assinging patients to doctor and rank the patients according to the severity of the disease, so that the doctors can hand 
sensible portion of time to that patient who is more severe. While building the architecture of the project, we made sure that
the software will be scalable and fast, as inconsistency or bug in the software will lead to critical state of the hospital. Our
software will be UI friendly, so that the admin/IT department of the hospital can operate it effortlessly without facing any
issue/error.



RELATED WORK
============
Archana Singh et.al proposed a system that uses machine learning to predict heart diseases. The machine learning algorithms that
was used to predict heart diseases were Support Vector Machine(SVM), Decision Tree, Linear Regression and K-nearest neighbor.
The models were trained and tested on UCI repository dataset. Out of all these algorithms, the accuracy of K-nearest algorithm 
was the best, i.e 87% and the metric used to test the all the models was confusion matrix.

G. Nandhini et.al conducted a study in which they used machine learning to predict chronic kidney disease on UCI repository 
which contains 400 datasets. The classification models that were used were Random Forest classifier, Logistic Regression and K-nearest 
neighbor(KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The study showed that Random Forest classfier performed best with the 
accuracy of 100%. 

Asif Ahmed Neloy et.al proposed a healty prediction system using machine learning and IBM Watson studio. They developed CPMS
Critical Patient Management system which is mobile application that uses real time data and on the basis of data, the machine 
learning model predict the health condition of the patient. If the condition of the patient gets poor, the app will send SMS to
the doctor and the nurse.

K. Shailaja  et.al conducted a study in which predicted several diseases such as heart disease, diabetic disease, thyroid disease and
breast cancer using various machine learning  models. The study showed that Naive Bayes gave 86% accracy for heart disease, CART
gave 79% accuracy for diabetes detection and SVM gave 96% accuracy for breast cancer.

Baki Koyuncu et.al proposed Intelligent Hospital management system which is a software that assists the patient to answer various
question before they get help from the doctor, as doctors are very busy and this software will save a lot of time. This
software does not prescripe any medicine, it only diagnose the patient based on a set of questions. The diagnoses helps the doctor
to have more clear vision to the problem in patient health.
